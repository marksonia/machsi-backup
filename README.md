Your open-source tool to backup your apps ... and their data
Requires Android 8.0 or newer.

For now most of the functionality and UI of the app are rewritten, next steps would be making it stable and adding some features which could ease the backup/restore workflow with any device. Therefore all types of contribution are welcome.

Now on functionality of our App:

It allows you to backup individual apps and their data.
Both backup and restore of individual programs one at a time and batch backup and restore of multiple programs are supported.
Restoring system apps should be possible without requiring a reboot afterwards.
Backups can be scheduled with no limit on the number of individual schedules and there is the possibility of creating custom lists from the list of installed apps.
